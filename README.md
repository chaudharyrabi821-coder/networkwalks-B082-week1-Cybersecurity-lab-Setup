3️⃣ NAT Network Configuration

What I Did

Created and configured a dedicated NAT Network in Oracle VirtualBox for the cybersecurity laboratory.

The network was configured using a private 10.0.0.0/24 address range, allowing virtual machines in the lab to communicate within the controlled environment while maintaining Internet connectivity through NAT.

Why

A dedicated NAT Network provides a controlled and isolated virtual networking environment for the cybersecurity lab. It also allows additional virtual machines to be connected later for authorized security-testing exercises.

Network Configuration
Network Type : NAT Network
Network CIDR : 10.0.0.0/24
DHCP         : Enabled
Gateway      : 10.0.0.1

🐞 Problems Encountered & Solutions

Documenting troubleshooting experiences demonstrates practical problem-solving skills and provides a reference for resolving similar issues in future laboratory setups.

Problem 1 — Internet Connectivity After Static IP Configuration

🔴 Issue

After manually configuring the IPv4 settings, the Kali Linux VM experienced Internet connectivity issues. This can occur when NetworkManager connection properties are not configured correctly for the selected network setup.

🔧 Troubleshooting

The NetworkManager connection was modified using:

sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dad-timeout 0

The network connection was then restarted, and connectivity was tested again.

✅ Result

Internet connectivity was successfully restored after applying the configuration and restarting the network connection.

💡 Important Note

Network connection names can vary between systems. Before modifying a connection, identify the actual connection name with:

nmcli connection show

Then replace "Wired connection 1" with the connection name shown on your system.

Problem 2 — VirtualBox VT-x / Hardware Virtualization Error

🔴 Issue

The Kali Linux VM initially failed to start because hardware virtualization was disabled in the system's BIOS/UEFI firmware.

🔧 Solution

The issue was resolved by:

Restarting the computer.

Entering the BIOS/UEFI settings.

Locating the hardware virtualization option.

Enabling Intel VT-x / Intel Virtualization Technology.

Saving the BIOS/UEFI configuration.

Restarting the computer.

Launching the Kali Linux VM again.

✅ Result

Hardware virtualization was enabled successfully, and the Kali Linux VM started normally in VirtualBox.

💡 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained practical experience in building and configuring a virtual cybersecurity laboratory using VirtualBox and Kali Linux.

The key concepts and skills I developed during Week 1 include:

1️⃣ NAT vs. NAT Network

I learned the difference between NAT and NAT Network configurations in VirtualBox.

A standard NAT configuration primarily provides Internet access to an individual virtual machine, while a NAT Network allows multiple virtual machines connected to the same virtual network to communicate with each other while also providing external network connectivity.

This makes NAT Network particularly useful for creating a multi-machine cybersecurity laboratory.

2️⃣ Virtual Machine Networking

I learned how VirtualBox virtual network adapters connect virtual machines to different types of networks.

I also gained an understanding of how network mode, IP addressing, gateways, and routing affect communication between virtual machines and external networks.

3️⃣ Static IP Configuration

I gained practical experience configuring and verifying IPv4 network settings in Kali Linux, including:

IPv4 address

Subnet mask / CIDR

Default gateway

DNS server

Network connectivity

I also practiced using Linux networking commands to verify and troubleshoot the configuration.

4️⃣ Virtual Machine Snapshots

I learned the importance of creating a clean VM snapshot before performing experimental or potentially disruptive activities.

A snapshot provides a known-good recovery point, making it easier to restore the laboratory environment when required.

5️⃣ Troubleshooting & Problem Solving

During the setup, I encountered networking and virtualization-related issues.

By troubleshooting these problems, I gained practical experience with:

NetworkManager

nmcli
IPv4 configuration
VirtualBox networking
BIOS/UEFI virtualization settings
Hardware virtualization

This helped me understand how to approach technical problems systematically rather than relying only on trial and error.

6️⃣ Technical Documentation

I learned that documentation is an important part of professional cybersecurity work.

Recording the environment, configurations, commands, screenshots, problems, solutions, and verification results makes the project easier to understand, reproduce, troubleshoot, and maintain.

🔐 Security & Ethics
This laboratory is intended for educational and authorized cybersecurity practice only.

Security testing should only be performed on systems, networks, applications, or devices that you own or have explicit permission to test.
